Introduction
Welcome to the XYZ Bank Automation System! This project aims to automate the basic functionalities of a bank branch, providing a seamless experience for both customers and bank staff. The system is designed to handle various types of accounts, each with its own unique features and restrictions.

Features
1. Over the Counter Activities
The system facilitates common over-the-counter activities, such as deposits, withdrawals, and account inquiries. Customers can easily perform these transactions with the help of bank staff, ensuring a quick and efficient banking experience.

2. Account Lifecycle
2.1 Savings Account
Savings accounts are tailored for individual use, requiring customers to maintain an average minimum balance of 10,000 INR. The system monitors and enforces this requirement to ensure account stability.

2.2 Salary Account
Similar to savings accounts, salary accounts have the added condition of requiring at least one transaction every two months. Failure to meet this condition results in the account being frozen, with the account holder promptly notified.

2.3 Current Account
Current accounts offer flexibility without specific restrictions. Customers can enjoy an overdraft facility, allowing them to withdraw up to a predefined maximum limit over the current balance.

2.4 Loan Account
Loan accounts are designed to track the repayment of loans taken by customers. These accounts start with a negative balance (loan amount) and accrue interest accordingly. The system efficiently manages loan-related transactions and calculations.

3. Interest Calculation
The system automates interest calculations for applicable accounts, ensuring accuracy and transparency in interest accrual. Interest rates are applied based on account types and balances, contributing to a fair and standardized banking experience.

4. End of Day Report
At the end of each day, the system generates a comprehensive report summarizing the day's transactions. This report serves as a valuable tool for bank management to review and reconcile daily activities.
